# Test WebApp Rendler

This project is a web application developed in Python, using the Flask framework, to demonstrate the implementation of a machine learning model for sales prediction in the context of the Rossmann drugstore chain.

## Project Structure

- `handler.py`: Main file containing the Flask application logic and routes for interacting with the prediction model.
- `model/`: Directory storing the trained machine learning model.
- `parameter/`: Directory containing the parameters used by the model.
- `rossmann/`: Directory with data and scripts related to the Rossmann use case.
- `Procfile`: File used to define the commands executed by the web server in the production environment.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mendesbeto/test-webapp-rendler.git
   cd test-webapp-rendler
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   `bash`
      `python -m venv venv
       source venv/bin/activate`  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    
3. **Install the dependencies:**

   bash
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
## Running the Application
   1. Start the Flask application:

      bash
      `python handler.py`
      
   3. Access the application in the browser:

      Open `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the application.

## Usage
   The application allows users to input data related to Rossmann stores and receive sales predictions based on the implemented machine learning model.
